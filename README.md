# Refactoring-Popo-Website

As the name suggest this repository was created to refactor the Popo-Website repository https://github.com/Nantha-R/Popo-Website. Once refactoring is done this repository will be replaced in place of the older one.

Popo Website repository was created for a 36 Hour Grand Finale of Smart India Hackathon 2017 on 1st and 2nd of April at Jaipur, Rajasthan.
